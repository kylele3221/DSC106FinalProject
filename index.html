          <p class="monsoon-lede">
            Monsoons are seasonal wind and rainfall patterns that bring
            life-sustaining rains to large parts of the world.

              <h3>Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM)</h3>
              <p>
                Each summer, moist winds rush inland from the Indian Ocean,
                bringing intense rains to South Asia between about 5°N and 35°N,
                from 60°E to 100°E.

              <p>
                Over West Africa, the monsoon delivers rainfall to the Sahel,
                from roughly 5°N to 20°N and 20°W to 20°E, sustaining crops and
                river systems.

                In South America, the monsoon system spans the Amazon and
                central Brazil, between about 5°N and 25°S, and 70°W to 35°W,
                shaping one of the world’s largest rainforest regions.

        <h2>Well, Why Does this Even Matter?</h2>
        <p class="climate-intro">
          According to NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement, rising temperatures intensify the
          Earth's water cycle. Increased evaporation fuels more frequent and intense storms in some
          regions, while drying others—meaning <strong>wet areas get wetter, and dry areas get drier</strong>.
          These shifts significantly impact agriculture, flooding, and global water security.
        </p>
    
        <!-- AGRICULTURE -->
        <div class="impact-block">
          <h3>1. Agriculture: Increasingly Unpredictable and Vulnerable</h3>
    
          <h4>In Wet Regions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flooded fields:</strong> Excess water drowns crops and damages roots</li>
            <li><strong>Soil erosion:</strong> Heavy rainfall strips away fertile topsoil</li>
            <li><strong>Plant diseases:</strong> Warm, humid conditions promote fungal outbreaks</li>
            <li><strong>Crop yield instability:</strong> Farmers face more frequent losses from storm damage</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h4>In Dry Regions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Drought stress:</strong> Insufficient water reduces crop yields</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced soil moisture:</strong> Dry, compacted soil becomes less productive</li>
            <li><strong>Shifting crop zones:</strong> Some crops can no longer grow in former regions</li>
            <li><strong>Higher irrigation demand:</strong> Farmers forced to rely more on groundwater or rivers that may also be shrinking</li>

        <div class="impact-block">
          <h3>2. Flooding: More Extreme and More Common Where Rain Increases</h3>
    
          <h4>In Wet Areas</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Intense rainstorms:</strong> Intense rainstorms dump large volumes of water quickly</li>
            <li><strong>River overflow:</strong> River basins flood more often</li>
            <li><strong>Urban flooding:</strong> Stormwater systems become overwhelmed</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal compound flooding:</strong> Heavy rain combines with rising sea-levels</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h4>In Dry Regions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flash flooding:</strong> Hard, dry soils absorb water poorly, causing sudden floods during rare storms</li>
            <li><strong>Overall trend:</strong> Chronic flooding decreases, while drought becomes dominant</li>

          <h4>In Wet Regions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent water supply:</strong> Water supply becomes inconsistent (long dry spells punctuated by huge storms)</li>
            <li><strong>Contamination risks:</strong> Floods contaminate drinking water with sewage or pollutants</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure stress:</strong> Reservoirs and dams face overflow risks</li>

          <h4>In Dry Regions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronic shortages:</strong> ess rainfall and higher evaporation dry out rivers, lakes, and aquifers</li>
            <li><strong>Groundwater depletion:</strong> People resort to pumping more groundwater than nature can replenish</li>
            <li><strong>Increased competition:</strong> Agriculture, cities, and ecosystems vie for limited water</li>
            <li><strong>Migration pressures:</strong> Water scarcity may force communities to relocate</li>

          1. What have you done so far? 
          So far, we have created the landing page of our project website, which has rain animation that reflects our monsoon topic. We also have created the next part, where we introduce what is a monsoon and the three specific monsoons we will focus on. We have implemented a rotating globe, in which when you click on each monsoon explanation section, the globe will rotate to the center of the monsoon. We have also created a radial plot of historic precipitation every month for years 1995~2014 to show how monsoons normally behave. Finally, we added some of the research we did on why focusing on monsoon patterns matter.
        </p>
        <p class="climate-intro">
          2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
          We believe the most challenging part of our project is to create three of everything because we are focusing on three major monsoons. Specifically, at the very end of the website we plan to have a world map with all the data, similar to our project 3. However, unlike project 3 where it did not zoom in, we are going to create a zoom in feature for all three of the monsoons and compare two SSPs. This requires a lot of data and involves a lot of interactive elements, which we believe will be the most challenging.
