      <h2 class="takeaway-title">One Climate, Many Realities</h2>

      <p class="takeaway-text">
        The most important insight from these visualizations is that 
        <strong>climate change does not affect monsoon regions uniformly.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="takeaway-text">
        Each system shows a different pattern of intensification, weakening, and
        spatial shift. This means
        <strong>policy responses must be region-specific, not based on global averages.</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="takeaway-text">
        Our difference maps reveal that while some areas within a monsoon region
        become significantly wetter, nearby areas grow drier, sometimes within
        the same country or watershed. This uneven redistribution of rainfall
        explains why impacts vary so widely across communities — from increasing
        flood risk to emerging drought vulnerability.
      </p>

      <p class="takeaway-text takeaway-highlight">
        <em>
          Understanding climate risk requires looking beyond
          overall rainfall trends and focusing on
          <strong>where water actually moves and who is affected by that movement.</strong>

        <h2>Writeup</h2>
        <p class="climate-intro">
          1. What have you done so far?
          So far, we have created the landing page of our project website, which
          has rain animation that reflects our monsoon topic. We also have
          created the next part, where we introduce what is a monsoon and the
          three specific monsoons we will focus on. We have implemented a
          rotating globe, in which when you click on each monsoon explanation
          section, the globe will rotate to the center of the monsoon. We have
          also created a radial plot of historic precipitation every month for
          years 1995~2014 to show how monsoons normally behave. Finally, we
          added some of the research we did on why focusing on monsoon patterns
          matter.
        </p>
        <p class="climate-intro">
          2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and
          why? We believe the most challenging part of our project is to create
          three of everything because we are focusing on three major monsoons.
          Specifically, at the very end of the website we plan to have a world
          map with all the data, similar to our project 3. However, unlike
          project 3 where it did not zoom in, we are going to create a zoom in
          feature for all three of the monsoons and compare two SSPs. This
          requires a lot of data and involves a lot of interactive elements,
          which we believe will be the most challenging.
