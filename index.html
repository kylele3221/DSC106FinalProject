            Monsoons are seasonal wind and rainfall patterns that bring
            life-sustaining rains to large parts of the world.

              <h3>Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM)</h3>
              <p>
                Each summer, moist winds rush inland from the Indian Ocean,
                bringing intense rains to South Asia between about 5°N and 35°N,
                from 60°E to 100°E.

              <h3>West African Monsoon (WAM)</h3>
              <p>
                Over West Africa, the monsoon delivers rainfall to the Sahel,
                from roughly 5°N to 20°N and 20°W to 20°E, sustaining crops and
                river systems.

              <p>
                In South America, the monsoon system spans the Amazon and
                central Brazil, between about 5°N and 25°S, and 70°W to 35°W,
                shaping one of the world’s largest rainforest regions.

          1. What have you done so far? 
          So far, we have created the landing page of our project website, which has rain animation that reflects our monsoon topic. We also have created the next part, where we introduce what is a monsoon and the three specific monsoons we will focus on. We have implemented a rotating globe, in which when you click on each monsoon explanation section, the globe will rotate to the center of the monsoon. We have also created a radial plot of historic precipitation every month for years 1995~2014 to show how monsoons normally behave. Finally, we added some of the research we did on why focusing on monsoon patterns matter.
        </p>
        <p class="climate-intro">
          2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
          We believe the most challenging part of our project is to create three of everything because we are focusing on three major monsoons. Specifically, at the very end of the website we plan to have a world map with all the data, similar to our project 3. However, unlike project 3 where it did not zoom in, we are going to create a zoom in feature for all three of the monsoons and compare two SSPs. This requires a lot of data and involves a lot of interactive elements, which we believe will be the most challenging.
